Pick 10 tags from stackoverflow.com

 like c#, php, java, javascript (example for c#: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%23

)

Once you've chosen the tags, you need to scrape these pages and then store all important information like number of questions, number of questions with answers, number questions with accepted answers, votes for the questions, votes for the answers, comments on the questions, comments on the answer, answers per question, and other stuff like this that you can think of.

You can store it in any kind of data store - a database, flat-files, etc.
